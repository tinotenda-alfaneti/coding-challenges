The problem l was doing was 287. For a deeper understanding of how the Floyd's bla bla works go to problem 287. I am not going to repeat myself.
I hope by the time you will read this you will be preparing for your last interview to land
a software engineering job boy. If not, keep pushing and praying Tino.
