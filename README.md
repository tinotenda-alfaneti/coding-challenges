# CODING CHALLENGES

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a site made up of problems specifically designed to prepare software engineers for potential interview questions. There are currently more than two thousand challenges available, all designed to test a candidateâ€™s knowledge of efficiency, patterns, and problem-solving. [Reference](https://www.mendix.com/blog/leetcode-in-mendix-the-sum-of-its-parts/)
